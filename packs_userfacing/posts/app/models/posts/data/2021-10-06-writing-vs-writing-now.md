So, I started this thing... "ship 30 for 30"[^1] after seeing a couple of nice posts by Matt Stine[^2]. Really, we haven't even really started yet. The first post is to come out Saturday, but in trying out this editor we're going to use throughout the course on thing struck me: In order for me to do this successfully I will to switch from writing to .. writing NOW.

When I work on Gradual Modularization[^3], I can usually sit with the idea for the next section or chapter until I feel, like I know what it is. Sometimes there is code to write first, which gives me a really good idea what I might need to write about. But fundamentally, I write when inspiration strikes... whenever that might be.

If I (or you!) want to write a short essay every day - one thing becomes ever so slightly more important - nah.. essential - ==to write==. Right now. To turn off the inner censor and go for it.

I write when I’m inspired, and I see to it that I’m inspired at nine o’clock every morning. — Peter DeVries[^4]

> In that spirit, when I had this thought. I wrote this. Looked it over once. And hit publish.

Off we go!
