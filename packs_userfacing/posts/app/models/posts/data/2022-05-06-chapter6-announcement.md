The message I sent to folks who bought [Gradual Modularization for Ruby and Rails](https://leanpub.com/package-based-rails-applications) about the publication of Chapter 6!

<!--more-->

## Dear readers!

I hope you are doing well!

Today I published a new chapter in "Gradual Modularization for Ruby on Rails!" - Chapter 6 covers privacy violations and how to manage them. The meat of the chapter comes at the end where we discuss one way of removing ActiveRecord from the boundary of a package. It is a doozie of a change to the interface and I have found this kind of change to always cause a lot of great discussions amongst engineers. In that spirit, please challenge my ideas and reach out via twitter [@shageman](https://twitter.com/shageman), stephanhagemann.com, or just set up time to chat https://calendly.com/stephan-hagemann/30min

Quick update on what I plan to write about next. For the moment, I think I have largely covered the software / code parts of the book. Two chapters I have fairly clear line of sight towards are 

* How to measure modularization progress
* Gradual Modularization in the context of BigRails (hint: check out GitHub.com/bigrails where my colleagues at gusto have started to release some of internal tooling as open source)

Stay tuned!

I look forward to hearing from you!

Stephan
