Happy New Year!
<!--more-->

Wishing you and yours some well-deserved downtime and a very happy new year to come!

## What's new?

I just finished the first iteration of Chapter 5 - Dependency Violation Management Refactorings and thought this would be a good time to reach out to you to let you know about recent updates as well as future plans.

Chapter 5 discusses seven dependency management techniques that allow us to shape the dependencies in our applications. They are:

* do nothing
* accept the dependency
* merge packages
* move code between packages
* duplicate functionality
* dependency injection
* switching to events

It is the last two techniques that I describe as complex to implement and very impactful on the application structure. Turns out, they are also really hard to get right and to write about. That said, a first pass means that I can, for this content, switch into edit mode and improve on what is there now. Your questions and comments are greatly appreciated as they guide me to where I need to make improvements the most! Feel free to reach out here or in whatever other medium you find me! Thank you!

## What's next?

I am grateful that the work for this book and the ideas behind it are fueling projects at my work at gusto (btw, I am hiring!). This means that the ideas you are reading about are not just theory, we are putting them into practice. I look forward to writing more about the organizational work that comes from gradual modularization.

Specifically, I intend to write about how to measure progress for modularization work and how to set up an org to effectively move towards a better application architecture using gradual modularization.

There are a few more technical things to wrap up. Right now, I have my eyes on a short chapter regarding privacy violation management techniques.

Here is to a productive 2022!

PS: A personal note - it is a mix of jet lag and shock that made me finish this Chapter over the past couple of days. Why shock? Because I live in Boulder County close to the Marshall Fire. My family and I are fine, but thousands of neighbors and friends are not. Please consider donating to help the victims. Thank you!
