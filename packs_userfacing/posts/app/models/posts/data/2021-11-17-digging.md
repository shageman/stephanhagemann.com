There is this thing called the *law of holes*[^1]. It's interesting...
<!--more-->

**2nd rule of holes:**
"When you stop digging, you are still in a hole"
This is true (but only if we read it as a continuation of the first part of the first rule of holes. I.e., you are in fact finding yourself in a hole)

**first rule of holes**
"If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging"
This is fun to say, easy to remember, and false

Here are some reasons why:

If you find yourself in a hole, you might be playing Lemmings[^1]

If you find yourself in a hole, you might be in civil engineering

If you find yourself in a hole, you might be a hole punch

If you find yourself in a hole, there might be no way out [^2]

If you find yourself in a hole, are you playing Indiana Jones again?

If you find yourself in a hole, climate change might have gotcha

If you find yourself in a hole, you may live close to mining

**If you find yourself in a hole. I hope you are safe. Try to remember whether you wanted to be there. Then decide what to do next**
