Zettelkasten VS Atomic Essays? More like ==Zettelkasten AND Atomic Essays!==
<!--more-->


Let's compare!

## Atomic Essays: Rapid publishing to learn writing

Atomic essays[^1] are a publishing and data gathering technique focussing on:
* Writing short essays that contain one idea
* Actually hitting that publish button (Practice over perfect)
* Gathering and analyzing data about article impact

==Stated goals are: "To think clearly, publish with prolific momentum, eliminate the friction of sharing ideas online, and create your niche by gathering data"[^1]==

## Zettelkasten: Idea collection and connection

The Zettelkasten[^2] method is a knowledge and idea organizing system that focuses on atomic ideas and creating connections between ideas. The ideas are atomic to make any connections between them unambiguous. The ideas are personal. It is described as a "holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life."[^3]

==Stated impacts are: "have an easier time doing knowledge work," "produce gems of knowledge"[^3]==

## Lots of overlap we can use to our advantage

Notice how much overlap there is between the two techniques. It actually is easier to list the differences:

==In Zettelkasten we explicitly connect atomic ideas with links. Atomic Essays don't emphasize linking. With Atomic Essays we write in public. Zettelkastens are private (seem to get published posthumously)==

# What would happen if we developed our Zettelkasten as a series of Atomic Essays in public?
