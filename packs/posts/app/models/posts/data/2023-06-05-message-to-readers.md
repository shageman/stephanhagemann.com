A message I sent to the readers of [Gradual Modularization for Ruby and Rails](//books/gradual-modularization/) regarding the new update published today.

<!--more-->

Hi there -

It has been a while that you have gotten an update to the book and it has been ages since I have given an update... and so much has happened to the gradual modularization eco system since then!!

Today, I would like to let you know that I have started the process of editing the existing. Yes, they desperately needed copy-editing, but more importantly, the content needed to be brought up-to-date with all the tools that have become available over the last 18 months.

This is a shift in approach for me, as I had hoped, up until a couple of months ago, that I could do one complete pass of the content first. However, in trying to write about how to create modularization progress I realized that what I was writing was out of step with what is possible today. So - plans changed.

While I don't expect to be able to go much faster going forward, please reach out via stephanhagemann.com or hey@stephanhagemann.com with any questions or comments. It is extremely motivating to hear from readers like you!

Cheers,
Stephan
